==================================
Publishing to the Knowledge Center
==================================

Once, long ago, in a galaxy far, far away, the
`Private Cloud section of the Knowledge Center
<http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/product-page/rackspace-private-cloud>`_
was where all the Private Cloud docs lived. It seemed like a good idea
at the time. It wasn't.

Now that we have come to our senses, the Knowledge Center is primarily a
central link-drop for RPC documentation and a place for RPC whitepapers,
case studies, technical articles, and other things that aren't likely to
change much after they've been published.

In the event that you're called upon to write a white paper or help
someone post a case study or article, you will need to use the Knowledge
Center. For major releases, you will also need to update our various
`waypointing posts
<http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/getting-started/rackspace-private-cloud>`_,
and possibly the `customer FAQ
<http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackspace-private-cloud-faq>`_.

Some of the content here has been adapted from the KC Content Creation
Process wiki.

.. note::

   If something is time-critical, it's a good idea to notify the
   `Knowledge Center team <mailto:knowledge_center@rackspace.com>`_
   as soon as you know the dates for it.

Knowledge Center account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get an account, contact knowledge_center@rackspace.com and ask to
have one created.

Once the account is created, you should be able to log in here:

http://ord.admin.kc.rakr.net/knowledge_center/user

When you're logged in, you'll be able to see your User page.

Authoring content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The KC's web interface isn't an authoring tool; it's a Drupal posting
tool similar to other blogging platforms that you may have used. So when
you write content that will eventually end up there, you will need to
develop it elsewhere and copy/paste it into KC. It's not ideal, but
that's life.

Depending on the type of content you are developing, you may write your
original document in Word using a template, in Google Docs, or on a
one.rackspace wiki page. If you're authoring in Word, you can use the
privatecloud-docs GitHub to save the content. Wherever you write it,
saving the source where other people can access is a good thing.

Creating a post on the KC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the fun part.

Once the content has been written, reviewed by the SMEs, and
peer-edited, it's time to post.

#. Log into the KC.
#. Click on **Add Content** in the upper left corner.
#. Select the type of content that you are adding. Generally you'll be
   posting a whitepaper or an article. You'll probably only ever use
   case study when helping someone else post it.

A **Create page** will open. The Create page will vary depending on what
kind of content you're adding; see "What to create when you're creating"
below for more information. 4. When you've finished adding the content
and setting the parameters, ensure that the Moderation State is in
"Draft" and click Save.

You can now view the draft as it will appear when published. Review it
and make sure it all looks good. At this point, you will also have a URL
that you can pass on to anyone who might be demanding one from you; in
the navigation bar it will appear as
http://ord.admin.kc.rakr.net/knowledge_center/article/<name-of-article>

The eventual customer-facing URL will be the same, just with
www.rackspace.com replacing ord.admin.kc.rakr.net.

What to create when you're creating
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Regardless of article type:

-  Product Type: Select "Rackspace Private Cloud".
-  Tags: Enter "rackspace private cloud"
-  Category: There aren't many categories specifically relevant to RPC;
   feel free to select "Uncategorized"
-  Categories v3: Optional; use your best judgement.

For Articles:

-  Article Type: "Standard Article", unless otherwise required.
   Exceptions will be rare.

For White Papers:

-  Whitepaper File: You will need to upload a PDF of the whitepaper, so
   be sure it's ready to go when you get to this point. The KC enables
   customers to download whitepaper PDFs.
-  Summary: A brief paragraph summarizing the content of the white
   paper.

Editing KC content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To edit the article, go to the ord.admin.kc.rakr.net article link
that was created when you saved the draft. Click on the **Edit Article**
link and edit away.

Note that you can do this even with published content; doing so creates
a new draft while preserving the currently published content on the
customer-facing web site.

In either case, when the editing is complete, proceed with "Submitting
KC content."

Submitting KC content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the draft is complete, you are now ready to submit it.

#. On the article's Create page, change the Moderation State to
   "Editorial Review" and save.
#. Send an email to knowledge_center@rackspace.com to notify them that
   the article is in Editorial Review and ready for publication.

A KC editor may review the content and get back to you with any changes.
If/when no more changes are required, you will be notified when the post
is public.
