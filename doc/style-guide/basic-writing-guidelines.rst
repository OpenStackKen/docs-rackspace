Writing guidelines
========================

Use these writing guidelines to create Rackspace content that's clear and
consistent, and that helps users accomplish their goals.

-  `Use active voice`_
-  `Use present tense`_
-  `Write to the user by using second person and imperative mood`_
-  `Write clear and concise sentences and paragraphs`_
-  `Use short, familiar words and phrases`_
-  `Use consistent terminology`_
-  `Use simple action verbs, and don't turn them into nouns`_
-  `Clarify gerunds and participles`_
-  `Back up statements with details`_
-  `Use interjections with care`_
-  `Use restrictive and nonrestrictive clauses correctly`_
-  `Clarify pronouns`_
-  `Use positive statements`_
-  `Use consistent references to time, space, and versions`_
-  `Use correct punctuation`_
-  `Avoid obscure non-English words and abbreviations`_
-  `Write for a global audience`_

Use active voice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Active voice makes the performer of the action, usually the user, the subject
of the sentence. Sentences that use the active voice are usually easier to
understand than sentences that use the passive voice.

In passive voice, the recipient (not the performer) of the action is the
subject of the sentence. Passive voice is usually less engaging and more
complicated than active voice. When you use passive voice, the actions and
responses of the technology can be difficult to distinguish from those of the
user. In addition, passive voice usually requires more words than active voice.

   * - Create a server.
     - A server is created by you.
   * - Rackspace products and services solve your business problems.
     - Your business problems are solved by Rackspace products and services.

Passive voice is acceptable in the following situations:

-  Using active voice sounds like you're blaming the user. For
   example, you can use passive voice in an error message or
   troubleshooting content when the active subject is the user.
-  The performer of action is unknown, or you want to de-emphasize the
   performer of the action and emphasize the object on which the action is
   performed.
-  Using active voice makes the sentence wordy or awkward.

       can't restrict the access of account owners.
     - In this context, the object, account owners, is more important than the
       actor, administrators.

Use present tense
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users read documentation to perform tasks or gather information. For them,
these activities occur in their present, so the present tense is appropriate in
most content. Additionally, present tense is easier to read than past or future
tense.

Use future tense only when you need to emphasize that something will occur
later, from the users' perspective.

.. tip::

   To easily find and remove instances of future tense, search for *will*.

     - Not applicable. Future tense is appropriate in this example.

.. _write-to-the-user:

Write to the user by using second person and imperative mood
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users are more engaged with documentation when it talks to them directly. You
accomplish this by using second person, that is, addressing the user as *you*.
Second person also promotes a friendly tone.

-  Use second person with the imperative mood (in which the subject *you* is
   understood) and active voice to eliminate wordiness and confusion about who
   or what initiates an action, especially in procedural steps.

-  Use second person to avoid the use of gender-specific, third-person pronouns
   such as *he*, *she*, *his*, and *hers*. If you must use third person, use
   the pronouns *they* and *their*, but ensure that the noun that the pronoun
   refers to is plural.

-  Use first-person plural pronouns (*we*, *our*) judiciously. These pronouns
   emphasize the writer or Rackspace rather than the user, so before you us
   them, consider whether second person or imperative mood is more "user
   friendly." However, use *we recommend* rather than *it's recommended* or
   *Rackspace recommends*. Also, you can use *we* in the place of *Rackspace*
   if necessary.

-  Use the first-person singular pronoun *I* only in the question part of FAQs
   and when authors of blogs or signed articles are describing their own
   actions or opinions.

-  Avoid switching person (point of view) in the same document. Switching
   person is acceptable, however, in blog posts that use first-person singular
   but then switch to second person for instructional steps.

Write clear and concise sentences and paragraphs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users can understand wordy and complex writing, and wade through walls of text,
but they shouldn't be forced to. Use the following guidelines to help you write
clear sentences and paragraphs.

-  `Use a consistent sentence
   structure <#use-a-consistent-sentence-structure>`__
-  `Restrict sentence length <#restrict-sentence-length>`__
-  `Use only the necessary words <#use-only-the-necessary-words>`__
-  `Create short paragraphs <#create-short-paragraphs>`__

Use a consistent sentence structure
-----------------------------------

As often as possible, use the sentence structure *subject*—*verb*—*object*.
Use simple declarative sentences for descriptions, and use simple imperative
sentences for instructions. However, you can use a sentence structure that
starts with an *if* clause or places the condition before the action.

   * - If you must monitor clients from the host, you can configure your
       settings in the directory.
     - You can configure your settings in the directory if you must monitor
       clients from the host.

Restrict sentence length
------------------------

Even when a long sentence is well written, it can be hard to follow and
understand. Try to limit sentences to 20-25 words. If you must write a longer
sentence, it should have more than one clause and the relationship between the
clauses should be clear.

     - After you choose a data center, the app retrieves a list of the
       containers that are hosted within that data center, along with the
       number of files in each container and the approximate size.
   * - Select whether to overwrite files with the same name or to restore files
       to their original folders. Then, click **Next**.
     - Click the check boxes to confirm whether you would like to Overwrite
       files with the same name or restore the files to their original folders
       and then click the **Next** button.

Use only the necessary words
----------------------------

Are you using adverbs (modifiers ending in *-ly*)? If so, you can remove most
of them without changing the meaning. What about adjectives? If they aren't
necessary to the meaning, remove them. Can prepositional phrases be shortened?
Are you using empty phrases that don't clarify the content?

     - The flexibility, extensibility, rich feature set and ease-of-use offered
       by SharePoint make it the logical choice for many businesses when it
       comes to their Collaboration, Content Management and Business
       Intelligence needs.
   * - In an environment where the product is running, you can use the ESP
       utility to monitor and audit your backup and recovery activities across
       the enterprise.
     - In an environment where the product is installed and running on one or
       more hosts, the ESP utility enables you to monitor your backup and
       recovery activities and audit your backup and recovery practices from an
       enterprise-wide perspective.

Although shorter is usually better, be sure to include all the words that are
necessary to make the meaning of a sentence clear the first time it's read.
Include all necessary articles (*a*, *an*, *the*), prepositions, connectors,
and other syntactic cues, such as those described in
`Clarify gerunds and participles <#clarify-gerunds-and-participles>`__,
`Use restrictive and nonrestrictive clauses
correctly <#use-restrictive-and-nonrestrictive-clauses-correctly>`__,
and `Clarify pronouns <#clarify-pronouns>`__.

Create short paragraphs
-----------------------

Short paragraphs are easier to scan and understand. Use the following
guidelines for paragraphs:

- Cover only one idea in each paragraph.
- Limit paragraphs to four to five sentences. However, avoid having
  one-sentence paragraphs.
- Use connective or transitional words to ensure flow within and between
  paragraphs.
- When listing three or more items, use a bullet list instead of embedding the
  items in a paragraph.

The following examples show how breaking up a long paragraph by using a
list makes it easy for the user to scan the text.

       When you delete a file, it's permanently removed from the Cloud Files
       container.

Use short, familiar words and phrases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use short, familiar words and phrases to convey an idea clearly. Such
words and phrases are more conversational, save space, are easier to
scan, and are often easier for non-native English speakers to
understand. Use a longer word or phrase only if necessary to convey a
special meaning.

If a word has variant spellings that are equally acceptable (such as
*canceled* and *cancelled*), use the shorter spelling.

       your questions about the service.
     - This guide is designed to get you up and running with the service and to
       answer any questions that you may have about the service.

Use consistent terminology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use words as they are defined in a general dictionary, in an accepted
industry dictionary or style guide, or for your particular project. Each
word or phrase should have only one meaning, and should be used
consistently throughout the documentation.

-  Don't use the same word to describe two or more different concepts.
   For example, don't use *agent* to refer to both a person and a
   process.

-  If a word has both a technical meaning and a general meaning, don't
   use it to express both meanings. Instead, use a synonym for the
   general meaning. For example, use *interface* as a noun that means
   user interface. Instead of also using *interface* as a verb, use
   *interact*.

-  Don't use different words to mean the same thing. Standardize on the
   use of one word for a particular object. Technical writing isn't
   creative writing, and you shouldn't be concerned that you will bore
   users with colorless prose. Clarity is the goal, so using a
   precise set of terms consistently is required. Following is a common
   example of multiple terms that refer to the same thing:

   -  menu command *(the preferred term)*
   -  menu item
   -  menu option

-  Use a word as only one part of speech. Many words can be correctly
   used as a verb and as a noun or an adjective, such as *display*.
   However, using the same word as more than one part of speech in the
   same document can be confusing to users and translators, so avoid
   it when possible.

-  Avoid fabricated words. Examples of fabricated words are
   *marketecture* or *edutainment*. Most such words are specific to a
   single business culture and aren't understood in other cultures.

-  Standardize words and spelling across a documentation set.

-  Don't use terms with different meanings interchangeably. Some terms
   have similar but distinct meanings and shouldn't be used
   interchangeably. For example:

   -  environment, platform
   -  version, release
   -  panel, screen
   -  window, dialog box

For guidelines about specific words, see :ref:`alphabetical-list-of-terms`.

Use simple action verbs, and don't turn them into nouns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verbs carry the action in a sentence, and they make your documentation
come alive for users. To make the biggest impact with your writing,
use strong, simple, action verbs, and use the guidelines in this
section.

-  `Use action-oriented verbs <#use-action-oriented-verbs>`__
-  `Avoid nouns built from verbs <#avoid-nouns-built-from-verbs>`__
-  `Use the simplest tense <#use-the-simplest-tense>`__
-  `Use helping verbs accurately <#use-helping-verbs-accurately>`__
-  `Use single-word verbs <#use-single-word-verbs>`__
-  `Don't use verbs as nouns or
   adjectives <#don't-use-verbs-as-nouns-or-adjectives>`__
-  `Don't use nonverbs as verbs <#don't-use-nonverbs-as-verbs>`__
-  `Use transitive verbs transitively, not
   intransitively <#use-transitive-verbs-transitively-not-intransitively>`__
-  `Don't humanize inanimate objects <#don't-humanize-inanimate-objects>`__

Use action-oriented verbs
-------------------------

Verbs are supposed to carry the action in a sentence. However, when you use
verbs like *be*, *have*, *make*, or *do* (and their variants), or when you use
gerunds (*-ing* words), nouns carry the action and weaken the meaning. Shift
the focus from nouns to verbs by replacing weak verbs and gerunds with strong,
action-oriented verbs. Relying on verbs rather than nouns usually makes
sentences shorter, clearer, and more direct.

     - You create a server **by specifying** a name, flavor, and image.
   * - When you **create** a server, ...
     - When **creating** a server, ...

Avoid nouns built from verbs
----------------------------

Many nouns are built from verbs, for example, *description* and *explanation*.
Such nouns are called *nominalizations*. Sentences that include a
nominalization *and* a verb can often be simplified by changing the
nominalization back into a verb and omitting the existing verb (as shown in the
following examples).

       tasks.
   * - The program **encrypts** user IDs and passwords.
     - The program **enables the encryption of** user IDs and passwords.

Use the simplest tense
----------------------

Simple verbs, such as verbs in the present tense, are easier to read and
understand than complex verbs, such as verbs in the progressive or
perfect tense, or verbs combined with helping verbs (such as *can*,
*may*, *might*, *must*, and *should*).

.. _helping-verbs:

Use helping verbs accurately
----------------------------

If you need to use the following helping verbs, use them accurately and
consistently:

- **Can**: Use *can* to indicate the ability to perform an action.
- **May**: Use *may* to indicate permission.
- **Might**: Use *might* to indicate probability or possibility.
- **Must**: You can use *must* to indicate the necessity of an action. However,
  in general, use the imperative mood, which implies the subject *you* and
  doesn't require *must* but still indicates necessity.
- **Should**: Use *should* to tell users what they *ought* to do. Because
  *should* implies uncertainty, avoid using it unless you explain further.

   * - The worker **must** delete the message when work is done.
   * - To avoid losing a claim in the middle of processing a message, clients
       **should** periodically renew claims during long-running batches of
       work.

Use single-word verbs
---------------------

When possible, use single-word verbs rather than phrasal verbs (verbs
followed by prepositions or adverbs). For example, use *omit* rather
than *leave out*, or shorten *start up* to *start*. One-word verbs are
easier to understand and to translate.

If you must use a phrasal verb, keep the parts of the verb together
unless that changes the meaning of the sentence. Some acceptable phrasal
verbs are *back up*, *log in*, *set up*, *shut down*, and *work around*.

.. note::

   Don't turn a phrasal verb into a single-word verb. For
   example, don't use *login*, *setup*, or *workaround* as verbs. These
   single-word terms should be used only as nouns or adjectives.

Don't use verbs as nouns or adjectives

noun or adjective. Some verbs that are commonly misused as nouns or
adjectives are *configure*, *compile*, *debug*, and *install*.

       bottom of the output text.
     - When the **compile process** is finished, the following message appears
       at the bottom of the output text.

Don't use nonverbs as verbs
----------------------------

Don't use nouns or adjectives as verbs, and don't add verb suffixes to
abbreviations, nouns, or conjunctions.

     - **CD** to the new directory.

Use transitive verbs transitively, not intransitively
-----------------------------------------------------

Transitive verbs, such as *load*, *display*, *complete*, and *execute*,
require a direct object. Intransitive verbs don't require a direct
object. Be sure to use each type of verb correctly.

To avoid using a transitive verb intransitively, you can make it passive
if the performer of the action is understood or not important.

Don't humanize inanimate objects
--------------------------------

Be careful not to ascribe human feelings, motivations, and actions to
inanimate objects. For example, a software program doesn't know, need,
remember, see, think, understand, or want. However, it can detect,
record, require, store, check, calculate, and process.

The following anthropomorphic verbs are acceptable in the computer
industry: accept, calculate, deny, detect, interact, interpret, listen,
refuse, read, and write.

Clarify gerunds and participles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Participles are verbs that end in *-ed* or *-ing* and act as modifiers. Gerunds
are verbs that end in *-ing* and act as nouns. Both types of words are useful
and acceptable, but confusion can arise if they aren't placed correctly in a
sentence. For example, the word *meeting* can be a gerund or a participle (or
even a noun) depending on its placement in a sentence. When you use gerunds and
participles, ensure that the meaning is clear.

     - When **using** a load balancer with a public-facing IP address, this

The last example illustrates a dangling modifier. In the "Avoid"
example, *using* doesn't have a subject, so the implied subject is
*address*, which is incorrect. If the implied subject isn't correct,
you must revise the sentence to provide a subject for the modifying
phrase.

Gerunds are used to start headings for process topics. Ensure that their
meaning is clear.

.. _use-interjections-with-care:

Use interjections with care
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An interjection is an emotional greeting or phrase, usually followed by
an exclamation point. For example, expressions such as *Hooray!*,
*Excuse me!*, *Sorry!*, *No thank you!*, *Oh dear!*, and *Hey, that's
mine!* are interjections.

In rare cases, an interjection might be appropriate. For example, at the
end of a procedure that targets *novice* users, you might write,
"Congratulations! You successfully created your first cloud server."

However, because the tone of an interjection can be condescending, use
them sparingly and with care.

.. _restrictive-clauses:

Use *that* and *which* correctly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A *restrictive* clause is essential to the meaning of a sentence because it
limits the noun to which it refers. If you omit a restrictive clause, you
change the meaning of the sentence. You indicate a restrictive clause with the
relative pronoun *that* or *who*, and you don't set off a restrictive clause
with commas.

A *nonrestrictive* clause doesn't change the core meaning of the
sentence. You set off a nonrestrictive clause with commas and the
relative pronoun *which* or *who*.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Restrictive clause
     - Nonrestrictive clause
   * - He hired the man **who came from Kansas**. (Not the man from Idaho)
     - Jackhammers, **which are useful for breaking up concrete**, are on sale.
   * - Enter the user name and password **that you just created**. (Not the
       user name and password that you created last month)
     - The hourly backups are rolled into a nightly backup, **which is retained
       for two days**.

Be sure to clarify restrictive clauses, as follows:

-  Include the relative pronoun (usually *that*). You can identify
   restrictive clauses in which *that* is missing by looking for two
   successive nouns.
-  Don't substitute *which* for *that*.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Use
     - Avoid
   * - Enter the user name and password **that you just created**.

   * - A task presents **information that a user needs** to achieve a
       specific goal.
     - A task presents **information a user needs** to achieve a specific
       goal.

       A task presents **information which a user needs** to achieve a
       specific goal.

Use pronouns sparingly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pronouns are useful, but you must ensure that their antecedents (the
words that they are used in place of) are clear, and that they (the
pronouns) don’t contribute to vagueness and ambiguity.

The following pronouns often cause problems, so use them carefully: *it*,
*this*, *there*, and *that*.

It
--

Ensure that the antecedent of *it* is clear. If multiple singular nouns
precede *it*, any of them could be the antecedent.

Avoid using *it is* (or *it's*) to begin a sentence. Such a construction hides the
real subject of the sentence.

   * - Use
     - Avoid
   * - You can store the value and use it again later.
     - The product stores the value in the configuration file. You can use it
       again later. (The antecedent of it could be the product, the value, or
       the file.)
   * - You must close all open windows before you run the script.
     - It is important that you close all open windows before you run the
       script.

This
----

Avoid beginning a sentence with the pronoun *this*, unless you follow
*this* with a noun to clarify its meaning.

     - This causes an error when you run the program.

There
-----

Avoid using *there is* and *there are* as the subject of a sentence or
clause. Using *there* shifts the focus away from the real subject and
often uses unnecessary words.

     - The Cloud Sites FTP service supports resumable uploading. This means
       that if there is a connection failure during an upload, it doesn't have
       to be started from the beginning.

That
----

Although you should use *that* as a relative pronoun (see `Use
restrictive and nonrestrictive clauses
correctly <#use-restrictive-and-nonrestrictive-clauses-correctly>`__),
avoid using it as a demonstrative pronoun (which stands in for or points
to a noun). Instead, use it as an adjective and follow it with a noun.

     - If you want to edit or delete your CNAME, you can also do that by
       managing your DNS in your existing tool.

Use positive statements

Positive statements are easier to understand than negative statements and are
typically shorter.

Also, try to avoid the following negative words, using instead the
suggested alternatives. However, always be honest and transparent about
issues.

Use consistent references to time, space, and versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following terms consistently:

   * - following, preceding
     - To locate an item in space

       **Note**: Don't use *above*, *below*, *earlier*, *later*, *before*, or
       *after* as references to information in text. Where possible, use
       specific references. If you can't make specific references, use
       *preceding* and *following* as adjectives for elements such as
       figures and tables.
     - The **preceding** information explains how to print a document
       correctly.

       The utility analyzes the **following** information to prepare the
       report.

     - To refer to product releases (version numbers).

       **Note**: Don't use *higher*, *lower*, *above*, *below*, *older*, or
       *newer*.
     - The required namespace kernel features aren't available in the default
       kernel shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4, CentOS 6.4, and
       **earlier** versions of these operating systems.

       Rackspace Private Cloud version 4.0 hasn't been tested on versions of
       Ubuntu **later** than 12.04.

Use correct punctuation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you use correct punctuation, you help users understand what you mean
*the first time* they read the text. Following are a few basic guidelines to
apply:

-  Use a comma before the last item in a series (known as the *serial*
   comma).
-  Use a comma to separate independent clauses, and be sure to include a
   coordinating conjunction.
-  Avoid using semicolons to separate clauses. They can make long
   sentences seem even longer. You can almost always use a period in the
   place of a semicolon.
-  Don't use a slash mark (/) to present a choice among, or a series
   of, actions or objects. Rewrite the phrase to eliminate the slash
   mark. Exceptions are established terms like *client/server* and
   *read/write*.

For additional specific punctuation guidelines and examples, see
:ref:`punctuation`. For basic rules about punctuation, see a grammar book,
such as the *Harbrace College Handbook*.

.. note::

   Avoid using exclamation points, question marks, ellipses, or
   single quotation marks in text. Although these punctuation marks might
   appear in code elements, messages, literal commands, or UIs, they're rarely
   useful when writing descriptions or instructions for users. One
   exception is the use of question marks in FAQ topics.

.. _avoid-obscure-words:

Avoid obscure non-English words and abbreviations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some non-English words and abbreviations might be unfamiliar to some users.
Latin abbreviations in particular, like *i.e.*, *e.g.*, and *etc.*, are
unnecessarily vague. The following table lists terms and abbreviations to
avoid, and their preferred alternatives.

     - versus, or an appropriate term

Write for a global audience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rackspace is a global company, with customers in many countries. A small
amount of content has been translated, but most has not, which means
that many customers who don't speak English as their first language
consume our English content. All of the guidelines in this topic ("Basic
writing guidelines") are designed to make content easy to understand for
all audiences, but the following guidelines will especially clarify
content for global audiences.

-  `Don't use idioms or
   colloquialisms <#don't-use-idioms-or-colloquialisms>`__
-  `Avoid metaphorical terms <#avoid-metaphorical-terms>`__
-  `Don't use humor <#don't-use-humor>`__
-  `Use jargon carefully <#use-jargon-carefully>`__
-  `Use culture-neutral language and
   examples <#use-culture-neutral-language-and-examples>`__
-  `Use culture-neutral graphics <#use-culture-neutral-graphics>`__
-  `Avoid abbreviated date formats <#avoid-abbreviated-date-formats>`__

Don't use idioms or colloquialisms
-----------------------------------

An *idiom* is an expression whose meaning can't be derived from the
literal meaning of the individual words. Some examples are *in a
nutshell*, *the bottom line*, *across the board*, and *on the fly*.

A *colloquialism* is an expression considered more appropriate to
familiar and casual conversation than to formal speech or to formal
writing. Although we might like to establish a more conversational tone
in some content, colloquialisms can be hard for non-native English
speakers to understand.

Avoid idioms and colloquialisms as often as possible.

The following table lists some idioms and colloquialisms, and provides
alternatives that you can use.

.. list-table::

   * - what's more
     - moreover
   * - a hair smaller than
     - slightly smaller than
   * - when you're done
     - when you're finished

Avoid metaphorical terms
------------------------

A *metaphor* is a figure of speech in which a word or phrase that
denotes one kind of object or action is used in place of another to
suggest a likeness or analogy between them. Although some common
metaphors are easy even for people who don't speak English as a first
language, avoid them as often as possible.

The following table provides some examples of metaphorical terms that
can easily be replaced with one or more words.

   * - the vanilla model
     - the standard model
   * - avoid common pitfalls
     - avoid common problems
   * - the drawback of frequent updates
     - the disadvantage of frequent updates

Don't use humor
----------------

Humor is culture specific. What might be funny in one culture might be
offensive or obscene in another culture. Humor doesn't translate well,
literally or figuratively, so don't use it.

Use jargon carefully
--------------------

*Jargon* is the specialized language of a profession. Jargon can be
useful for technical audiences, but it can be meaningless to novice
users and difficult to translate. Don't use jargon if you can
easily and correctly use a more common or familiar term, or if the
jargon obfuscates rather than clarifies the meaning. However, if the
jargon is essential to the technical meaning of the content, use it. If
the audience isn't highly technical, consider explaining any jargon
that you use.

The following table lists some jargon typically used in the high tech
industry and some possible alternatives.

Use culture-neutral language and examples
-----------------------------------------

Cultural references and examples in your documentation can cause
problems for a global audience and for translation. Sounds, colors,
animals, gestures, events, and symbols don't convey the same meaning in
every culture.

-  Don't use the names of places, public figures, or holidays. If you
   must, use examples that represent a variety of cultures or that are
   internationally recognized. For example, use international cities,
   such as Paris, New York, Tokyo, London, and Hong Kong.

-  Don't use political, religious, ethnic, or historical references.

-  Don't use metaphors that are specific to one culture (for example,
   an American football metaphor).

Use generic examples that work in any target market.

If you create "named" users for extended examples or scenarios, use
names that represent a variety of ethnic backgrounds, genders, and
locations.

Use culture-neutral graphics
----------------------------

Use graphics whenever possible to present processes and complex ideas.
However, be aware of the following possible issues:

-  Some users don't typically read from left to right. If a
   graphics illustrates a sequence, make that sequence explicit by using
   numbers, arrows, or directional terms.

-  Don't rely on color alone to convey meaning. The color red, for
   example, has different meanings in different countries so could be
   interpreted differently by different users. Also, colors can have
   political or religious significance. Use neutral colors as often as
   possible.

-  Don't use a picture of a hand by itself (for example, a hand that is
   pointing). Almost every hand gesture is offensive to someone. A
   picture of a hand that is holding an item or interacting with
   something is generally acceptable.

-  Use generic or international images. Some examples are soccer players
   and equipment, generic landscapes, pens and pencils, and generic
   images of computer equipment. Avoid using images of men, women,
   flags, maps, animals, alcohol, trendy objects, historical references,
   or film, cartoon, or video characters.

Avoid abbreviated date formats
------------------------------

Date formats vary among cultures. Write out dates, unless you're
showing a literal representation as it's displayed in the software or
you need to use an abbreviation in a table or figure. If you use
abbreviations, include an explanation and use the abbreviated format
consistently.
