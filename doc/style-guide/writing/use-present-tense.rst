=================
Use present tense
=================

Users read documentation to perform tasks or gather information. For them,
these activities occur in their present, so the present tense is appropriate in
most content. Additionally, present tense is easier to read than past or future
tense.

Use future tense only when you need to emphasize that something will occur
later, from the users' perspective.

.. tip::

   To easily find and remove instances of future tense, search for *will*.
