Fork a repository
=================

After you have created your GitHub account, to see a list of external
repositories go to https://github.com/rackerlabs. For a list of internal
repositories, go to https://github.rackspace.com/IX. For Information
Development projects, you will most likely work with multiple repositories.
Check with your team lead to identify the repositories with which you will
work.

Although you have permission to do so, do not make changes directly to the
master branch of the repository on GitHub. Instead, fork the Master branch,
which makes a copy of the repository under your username. For example,
master branch https://github.rackspace.com/IX/docs-starter-kit becomes
fork https://github.rackspace.com/cath6184/docs-starter-kit. The master
branch reflects a production-ready state, which is the most up-to-date docs.

1. Log in to ``Rackerlabs`` or ``IX`` and locate the repository you want to
   fork.

2. Click the repository, and click **Fork**, which is in the upper right-hand
   side of the page.

3. When prompted, click your profile.

   GitHub adds the forked branch to your GitHub account.
