===================
Fork a repository
===================

After you have created your GitHub account, go to Rackspace Hosting for a list
of public Rackspace repositories. For Information Development projects, it is
likely you will work with multiple repositories. Check with your team lead to
identify the repositories with which you will work.
You do not have permission to make changes directly to the repository on GitHub.
Instead, you fork the Master branch, which adds a copy of the repository to your
GitHub account. The Master branch reflects a production-ready state, which in
this case is the most up-to-date docs.

1. Log in to Rackerlabs and locate the repository you want to fork.

2. Click the repository, and click Fork.

3. When prompted, click your profile.
GitHub adds the forked branch to your GitHub account.
