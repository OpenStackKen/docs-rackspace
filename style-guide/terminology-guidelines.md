# Terminology

This topic provides guidelines for using terms in Rackspace documentation.

- [Alphabetical list of terms](#alpha-terms) provides usage guidelines for common words and technical terms that are used in Rackspace content.

- [Concise terms](#concise-terms) lists typical wordy terms and phrases and provides shorter alternatives that you can use instead.  

- [Third-party names and trademarks](#third-party-terms) shows the correct spelling and capitalization of third-party names and trademarks.

## <a name="alpha-terms"></a>Alphabetical list of terms
This section provides usage guidelines for general terms. The table indicates the following special types of terms:

- *Restricted*: Terms that can create problems if used incorrectly
- *Avoid*: Terms to avoid in favor of better alternatives
- *Do not use*: Terms that should not be used

A blank cell in the "Special Usage" column indicates that a word is generally acceptable and should be used as directed in the "Comments" column.

Additionally, the table uses the following abbreviations to indicate parts of speech:
- (v)=verb
- (n)=noun
- (adj)=adjective
- (adv)=adverb

billion	| Avoid | *Billion* indicates different numbers in different numeration systems. In the short-scale system (used in the English-speaking countries), it indicates 10<sup>9</sup>, or 1,000,000,000. In the long-scale system (used in Spanish-speaking countries), it indicates 10<sup>12</sup>, or 1,000,000,000,000. <br /><br /> To avoid confusion when you are citing a large number such as a billion, express the amount in numerals. If space constraints prevent writing numerals, use *billion* as defined in the short-scale system.
