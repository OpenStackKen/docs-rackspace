<p>This section provides usage guidelines for general terms. The table indicates the following special types of terms:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Restricted</em>: Terms that can create problems if used incorrectly</li>
<li><em>Avoid</em>: Terms to avoid in favor of better alternatives</li>
<li><em>Do not use</em>: Terms that should not be used</li>
</ul>
<p>A blank cell in the &quot;Special Usage&quot; column indicates that a word is generally acceptable and should be used as directed in the &quot;Comments&quot; column.</p>
<p>Additionally, the table uses the following abbreviations to indicate parts of speech:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>(v)=verb</li>
<li>(n)=noun</li>
<li>(adj)=adjective</li>
<li>(adv)=adverb</li>
</ul>

appendixes | | As the plural of <em>appendix</em>, use <em>appendixes</em> rather than <em>appendices</em>.
architect (v), architected (adj) |  Do not use | Use <em>architect</em> only as a noun. For a verb, use <em>design</em>, <em>create</em>, <em>plan</em>, or another appropriate verb. <br /><br /> Instead of using <em>architected</em> as an adjective, use <em>designed</em> or another appropriate word.

before | | Use <em>before</em> to mean to precede in time or order of actions. <br /> <br /> Do not use <em>before</em> to refer to the location of information. Instead, use <em>previous</em>, <em>preceding</em>, or provide a specific cross-reference. <br /><br /> <em>Use:</em> <br /> Before you change the DNS of your domain, you can use the URL to test your website. <br /> Because the entity recipe precedes this stanza, it implicitly selects the entityId for this or any check in scope. <br /><br /> <em>Do not use:</em> <br /> Because the entity recipe is placed before this stanza, it implicitly selects the entityId for this or any check in scope.below   | Restricted | Do not use <em>below</em> to locate information within a topic or a deliverable or to refer to releases or product versions. <br /><br /> To locate information, use <em>following</em> or provide a specific link or cross-reference. <br /><br /> To refer to releases or product versions, use <em>earlier</em>. <br /><br /> <em>Use:</em> <br /> In the following example, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cbsvolume1</span></code> is the name of the volume. <br /> You can use netstat to confirm whether a super-server is listening on a specific port.

billion | Avoid | <em>Billion</em> indicates different numbers in different numeration systems. In the short-scale system (used in the English-speaking countries), it indicates 10<sup>9</sup>, or 1,000,000,000. In the long-scale system (used in Spanish-speaking countries), it indicates 10<sup>12</sup>, or 1,000,000,000,000. <br /><br /> To avoid confusion when you are citing a large number such as a billion, express the amount in numerals. If space constraints prevent writing numerals, use <em>billion</em> as defined in the short-scale system.
biweekly, bimonthly | Avoid |   Because these terms can be interpreted as <em>twice a week or month</em> or <em>once every two weeks or months</em>, avoid using them. For clarity, instead use longer terms such as <em>every two weeks</em>, <em>every two months</em>, <em>twice a week</em>, and <em>twice a month</em>.
Boolean | | Always use with an initial capital letter.
both    | | Use to refer to only two things. <br /><br /> <em>Use:</em> <br /> To prevent both headers and I/O summaries from being printed, use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">“-qqq”</span></code>. <br /> OpenStack  provides large, medium, and small organizations an alternative to closed cloud environments.  <br /><br /> <em>Do not use:</em> <br /> OpenStack provides both large, medium, and small organizations an alternative to closed cloud environments.bottom left, bottom right   | Do not use | When referring to the location of an item on a UI, use <em>lower left</em> and <em>lower right</em> instead. See <a class="reference external" href="#left">left</a> and <a class="reference external" href="#right">right</a>.
box | | Use <em>box</em> instead of <em>field</em> to describe a box (including a text box, list box, group box, combo box, and spin box) within a dialog box or window. When citing a specific UI element name, use only box with the name (for example, <strong>Candidate</strong> box, not <strong>Candidate</strong> list box) except when naming a check box. In contrast, when citing one of these terms generically, use the complete term, such as <em>list box</em>. <br /><br /> <strong>Note:</strong> Do not use <em>box</em> to refer to a computer. <br /><br /> <em>Use:</em> <br /> In the <strong>Search <em>n</em> activities</strong> box, enter your search term. <br /> Select the <strong>Printer</strong> and <strong>Clipboard</strong> check boxes. <br /> Complete each list box.
bring up |  Do not use | Do not use this term to refer to starting or turning on a system. Use <em>start</em> or <em>turn on</em> instead. <br /><br /> Do not use this term to refer to the opening of a window or part of a UI. Use <em>open</em> instead. <br /><br /> <em>Use:</em> <br /> Press the <strong>F1</strong> key to open a help screen with the keyboard commands. <br /> To start <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">eth1</span></code> without restarting the device, use the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ifup</span></code> command. <br /><br /> <em>Do not use:</em> <br /> Press the <strong>F1</strong> key to bring up a help screen with the keyboard commands. <br /> To bring up <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">eth1</span></code> without restarting the device, use the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ifup</span></code>  command.
button | | Do not use <em>button</em> and <em>icon</em> interchangeably. If you are referring to a command button or toolbar button (labeled or unlabeled), use <em>button</em>. If you are referring to a graphic on a screen, window, or other area, use <em>icon</em>. <br /> <br /> When providing an instruction to click a button that executes a command, use the name of the button without the word <em>button</em>. <br /><br /> <em>Use:</em> <br /> To save the configuration, click <strong>OK</strong>.
by using | | See <a class="reference external" href="#using">using, by using, with</a>.
can <a name="can"></a> | | Use <em>can</em> to indicate the power or ability to perform an action. See also <a class="reference external" href="#may">may</a>, <a class="reference external" href="#might">might</a>, <a class="reference external" href="#must">must</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="#should">should</a>. <br /><br /> <em>Use:</em> <br /> You can shorten phase 1 by eliminating unneeded files, such as archived logs and application cache files, from the original cloud server.

choose | Restricted | In procedure steps, use <em>select</em> when referring to actions in the UI. <em>Choose</em> is acceptable in a general sense.
clear (v)   | | Use <em>clear</em> to mean the opposite of <em>select</em> or <em>enter</em>. Do not use <em>deselect</em> or <em>unselect</em>.
click <a name="click"></a>| | Use <em>click</em> to mean press and release a mouse button. Use <em>click</em> to refer to operations and selections that you make with a mouse. Do not use <em>click on</em> or <em>press</em>. <br /><br /> <em>Use:</em> <br /> Click <strong>OK</strong>. <br /> <br /> <em>Do not use:</em> <br /> Click on <strong>OK</strong>. <br /> Press <strong>OK</strong>.
client  | | Use <em>client</em> to refer to a computer, object, or program that obtains data or services from a server. If the context is clear, you can use <em>client</em> as a noun. If the context is not clear, use <em>client</em> as an adjective (for example, <em>client computer</em>). <br /><br /> Do not use <em>client</em> to refer to a person. Use <em>customer</em> instead. <br /><br /> <em>Use:</em> <br /> Routing directs client requests to the content source best able to serve the request. <br /> The client interacts with the remote file system through the  SSH File Transfer Protocol  (SFTP). <br /> Because no two customers are the same, the company is aware of the need for customizable platforms.client/server | | Use a slash, not a hyphen.
cloud   | | When using <em>cloud</em> as a general noun or adjective, use lowercase.
