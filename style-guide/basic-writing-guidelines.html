<p>As often as possible, use the sentence structure <em>subject</em>—<em>verb</em>—<em>object</em>. Use
simple declarative sentences for descriptions, and use simple imperative
sentences for instructions. However, you can use a sentence structure that
starts with an <em>if</em> clause or places the condition before the action.</p>

<p>Even when a long sentence is well written, it can be harder to follow and
understand than a comparatively shorter sentence. For procedural
(task-oriented) information, try to limit sentences to 20 words. For conceptual
information, try to limit sentences to 25 words. If you must write a longer
sentence, it should have more than one clause and the relationship between the
clauses should be clear.</p>

<p>Ask yourself whether customers need to be told everything you are telling them.
Is anything so obvious that it does not need to be said? Are you using adverbs
(modifiers ending in <em>-ly</em>)? If so, most of them can be removed without harming
the meaning. Examine your use of adjectives. If they are not needed, remove
them. Can prepositional phrases be shortened? Are you using empty phrases that
do not clarify the content?</p>

<span id="use-active-voice"></span><h2>Use active voice<a class="headerlink" href="#use-active-voice" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>In general, write in <em>active</em> voice rather than <em>passive</em> voice.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Active voice identifies the agent of action as the subject of the
verb—usually the user.</li>
<li>Passive voice identifies the recipient (not the source) of the action as the
subject of the verb.</li>
</ul>
<p>Active-voice sentences clarify the performer of an action and are easier to
understand than passive-voice sentences. Passive voice is usually less engaging
and more complicated than active voice. When you use passive voice, the actions
and responses of the software can be difficult to distinguish from those of the
user. In addition, passive voice usually requires more words than active voice.</p>

<p>However, passive voice is acceptable in the following situations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Using active voice sounds like you are blaming the customer. For example, you
can use passive voice in an error message or troubleshooting content when the
active subject is the customer.</li>
<li>The agent of action is unknown, or you want to de-emphasize the agent of
action and emphasize the object on which the action is performed.</li>
<li>Recasting the sentence in active voice is wordy or awkward.</li>

<p>Customers read documentation to perform tasks or gather information. For them,
these activities take place in their present, so the present tense is
appropriate in most cases. Additionally, present tense is easier to read than
past or future tense.</p>
<p>Use future tense only when you need to emphasize that something will occur
later (from the customers' perspective). To easily find and remove instances of
future tense, search for <em>will</em>.</p>

<p>Customers are more engaged with documentation when you use second person (that
is, you address the customer as <em>you</em>). Second person promotes a friendly tone
by addressing customers directly. Using second person with the imperative mood
(in which the subject <em>you</em> is understood) and active voice helps to eliminate
wordiness and confusion about who or what initiates an action, especially in
procedural steps.</p>
<p>Using second person also avoids the use of gender-specific, third-person
pronouns such as <em>he</em>, <em>she</em>, <em>his</em>, and <em>hers</em>. If you must use third person,
use the pronouns <em>they</em> and <em>their</em>, but ensure that the pronoun matches the
referenced noun in number.</p>
<p>Use first person plural pronouns (<em>we</em>, <em>our</em>) judiciously. These pronouns
emphasize the writer or Rackspace rather than the customer, so before you use
them, consider whether second person or imperative mood is more &quot;user
friendly.&quot; However, use <em>we recommend</em> rather than <em>it is recommended</em> or
<em>Rackspace recommends</em>. Also, you can use <em>we</em> in the place of <em>Rackspace</em> if
necessary.</p>
<p>The first-person singular pronoun <em>I</em> is acceptable in the question part of
FAQs and when authors of blogs or signed articles are describing their own
actions or opinions.</p>
<p>Avoid switching person (point of view) in the same document. Switching person
is acceptable, however, in blog posts that use first-person singular but then
switch to second person for instructional steps.</p>

<div class="section" id="use-consistent-terminology">
<span id="use-consistent-terminology"></span><h2>Use consistent terminology<a class="headerlink" href="#use-consistent-terminology" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Use words as they are defined in a general dictionary, in an accepted industry
dictionary or style guide, or for your particular project. Each word or phrase
should have only one meaning, and should be used consistently throughout the
documentation.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Don't use the same word to describe two or more different concepts. For
example, don't use <em>agent</em> to refer to both a person and a process.</li>
<li>If a word has both a technical meaning and a general meaning, don't use it to
express both meanings. Instead, use a synonym for the general meaning. For
example, use <em>interface</em> as a noun that means user interface. Instead of also
using <em>interface</em> as a verb, use <em>interact</em>.</li>
<li>Don't use different words to mean the same thing. Standardize on the use of
one word for a particular object. Technical writing is not creative writing,
and you should not be concerned that you will bore customers with colorless
prose. Clarity is the goal, so using a precise set of terms consistently is
required. Following is a common example of multiple terms that refer to the
same thing:<ul>
<li>menu command <em>(the preferred term)</em></li>
<li>menu item</li>
<li>menu option</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Use a word as only one part of speech. Many words can be correctly used as a
verb and as a noun or an adjective, such as <em>display</em>. However, using the
same word as more than one part of speech in the same document can be
confusing to customers and translators, so avoid it when possible.</li>
<li>Avoid fabricated words. Examples of fabricated words are <em>marketecture</em> or
<em>edutainment</em>. Most such words are specific to a single business culture and
are not understood in other cultures.</li>
<li>Standardize words and spelling across a documentation set.</li>
<li>Don't use terms with different meanings interchangeably. Some terms have
similar but distinct meanings and should not be used interchangeably. For
example:<ul>
<li>environment, platform</li>
<li>version, release</li>
<li>panel, screen</li>
<li>window, dialog box</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>When you use weak verbs like <em>be</em>, <em>have</em>, <em>make</em>, or <em>do</em> (and their
variants), or when you use gerunds (<em>-ing</em> words), nouns instead of verbs carry
the main action of the sentence. Shift the focus from nouns to verbs by
replacing weak verbs and gerunds with strong, action-oriented verbs. Relying on
verbs rather than nouns usually makes sentence shorter, clearer, and more
direct.</p>

<p>Many nouns that we commonly use are built from verbs. When a verb is
transformed into a noun, the resulting noun is called a <em>nominalization</em>.
Sentences that include a nominalization and a verb can often be simplified by
changing the nominalization back into a verb and omitting the existing verb (as
shown in the following examples). Excessive and unnecessary use of
nominalizations contributes to wordiness and dilutes meaning. Omit them when
possible.</p>

<em>using</em> does not have a subject, so the implied subject is <em>address</em>, which is
incorrect. If the implied subject is not correct, you must revise the sentence

<p>An interjection is an emotional greeting or phrase, usually followed by an
exclamation point. For example, expressions such as <em>Hooray!</em>, <em>Excuse me!</em>,
<em>Sorry!</em>, <em>No thank you!</em>, <em>Oh dear!</em>, and <em>Hey, that's mine!</em> are
interjections.</p>
<p>In rare cases, an interjection might be appropriate. For example, at the end of
a procedure that targets <em>novice</em> customers, you might write, &quot;Congratulations!
You successfully created your first cloud server.&quot;</p>
<p>However, because the tone of an interjection can be condescending, use them
sparingly and with care.</p>

<div class="section" id="use-correct-punctuation">
<span id="use-correct-punctuation"></span><h2>Use correct punctuation<a class="headerlink" href="#use-correct-punctuation" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>When customers have to reread a sentence or paragraph to understand it, faulty
punctuation is often the culprit. Following are some common situations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A comma is omitted.</li>
<li>An unnecessary comma is used.</li>
<li>A long sentence contains overly complex punctuation.</li>
<li>A parenthetical phrase occurs in the middle of an instruction.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these situations can inhibit comprehension. By using correct punctuation
in general, keeping sentences short, and using consistent punctuation in lists,
procedures, and tables, you help customers to understand what you mean <em>the
first time</em> they read the text. Following are a few basic guidelines to apply:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Use a comma before the last item in a series (known as the <em>serial</em> comma).</li>
<li>Use a comma to separate independent clauses, and be sure to include a
coordinating conjunction.</li>
<li>Avoid using semicolons to separate clauses. They can make long sentences seem
even longer. You can almost always use a period in the place of a semicolon.</li>
<li>Do not use a slash mark (/) to present a choice among, or a series of,
actions or objects. Rewrite the phrase to eliminate the slash mark.
Exceptions are established terms like <em>client/server</em> and <em>read/write</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For additional specific punctuation guidelines and examples, see
<a class="reference external" href="m-z-style-guidelines.html#punctuation">Punctuation</a>. For basic rules about
punctuation, see a grammar book, such as the <em>Harbrace College Handbook</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Avoid using exclamation points, question marks, ellipses (three
dots), or single quotation marks in text. Although these punctuation marks
might appear in code elements, messages, literal commands, or UIs, they are
rarely useful when writing descriptions or instructions for customers. One
exception is the use of question marks in FAQ topics.</p>

<p>Humor is culture specific. What might be funny in one culture might be

<p><em>Jargon</em> is the specialized language of a profession. Jargon can be useful for
technical audiences, but it can be meaningless to novice customers and
difficult to translate. Do not use jargon if you can easily and correctly use a
more common or familiar term, or if the jargon obfuscates rather than clarifies
the meaning. However, if the jargon is essential to the technical meaning of
the content, use it. If the audience is not highly technical, consider
explaining any jargon that you use.</p>
<p>The following table lists some jargon typically used in the high tech industry
and some possible alternatives.</p>
<p><strong>Use with Caution:</strong> This list is under construction as we determine what
jargon is acceptable. If one of these terms is used in content that is provided
by support or development, determine whether it is appropriate for the
audience.</p>

<span id="use-culture-neutral-language-and-examples"></span><h3>Use culture-neutral language and examples<a class="headerlink" href="#use-culture-neutral-language-and-examples" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Cultural references and examples in your documentation can cause problems for a
global audience and for translation. Sounds, colors, animals, gestures, events,
and symbols do not convey the same meaning in every culture.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Do not use the names of places, public figures, or holidays. If you must, use
examples that represent a variety of cultures or that are internationally
recognized. For example, use international cities, such as Paris, New York,
Tokyo, London, and Hong Kong.</li>
<li>Do not use political, religious, ethnic, or historical references.</li>
<li>Do not use metaphors that are specific to one culture (for example, an
American football metaphor).</li>
</ul>
<p>Use generic examples that work in any target market.</p>
<p>If you create &quot;named&quot; users for extended examples or scenarios, use names that
represent a variety of ethnic backgrounds, genders, and locations.</p>

<div class="section" id="use-culture-neutral-graphics">
<span id="use-culture-neutral-graphics"></span><h3>Use culture-neutral graphics<a class="headerlink" href="#use-culture-neutral-graphics" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Use graphics whenever possible to present processes and complex ideas. However,
be aware of the following possible issues:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Some customers do not typically read from left to right. If a graphics
illustrates a sequence, make that sequence explicit by using numbers, arrows,
or directional terms.</li>
<li>Do not rely on color alone to convey meaning. The color red, for example, has
different meanings in different countries so could be interpreted differently
by different customers. Also, colors can have political or religious
significance. Use neutral colors as often as possible.</li>
<li>Do not use a picture of a hand by itself (for example, a hand that is
pointing). Almost every hand gesture is offensive to someone. A picture of a
hand that is holding an item or interacting with something is generally
acceptable.</li>
<li>Use generic or international images. Some examples are soccer players and
equipment, generic landscapes, pens and pencils, and generic images of
computer equipment. Avoid using images of men, women, flags, maps, animals,
alcohol, trendy objects, historical references, or film, cartoon, or video
characters.</li>

<p>Date formats vary among cultures. Write out dates, unless you are showing a
literal representation as it is displayed in the software or you need to use an
abbreviation in a table or figure. If you use abbreviations, include an
explanation and use the abbreviated format consistently.</p>
