<div class="section" id="use-active-voice">
<h2>Use active voice<a class="headerlink" href="#use-active-voice" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Active voice makes the performer of the action, usually the user, the subject
of the sentence. Sentences that use the active voice are usually easier to
understand than sentences that use the passive voice.</p>
<p>In passive voice, the recipient (not the performer) of the action is the
subject of the sentence. Passive voice is usually less engaging and more
complicated than active voice. When you use passive voice, the actions and
responses of the technology can be difficult to distinguish from those of the
user. In addition, passive voice usually requires more words than active voice.</p>

<p>Passive voice is acceptable in the following situations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Using active voice sounds like you're blaming the user. For
example, you can use passive voice in an error message or
troubleshooting content when the active subject is the user.</li>
<li>The performer of action is unknown, or you want to de-emphasize the
performer of the action and emphasize the object on which the action is
performed.</li>
<li>Using active voice makes the sentence wordy or awkward.</li>

<p>Users are more engaged with documentation when it talks to them directly. You
accomplish this by using second person, that is, addressing the user as <em>you</em>.
Second person also promotes a friendly tone.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Use second person with the imperative mood (in which the subject <em>you</em> is
understood) and active voice to eliminate wordiness and confusion about who
or what initiates an action, especially in procedural steps.</li>
<li>Use second person to avoid the use of gender-specific, third-person pronouns
such as <em>he</em>, <em>she</em>, <em>his</em>, and <em>hers</em>. If you must use third person, use
the pronouns <em>they</em> and <em>their</em>, but ensure that the noun that the pronoun
refers to is plural.</li>
<li>Use first-person plural pronouns (<em>we</em>, <em>our</em>) judiciously. These pronouns
emphasize the writer or Rackspace rather than the user, so before you us
them, consider whether second person or imperative mood is more &quot;user
friendly.&quot; However, use <em>we recommend</em> rather than <em>it's recommended</em> or
<em>Rackspace recommends</em>. Also, you can use <em>we</em> in the place of <em>Rackspace</em>
if necessary.</li>
<li>Use the first-person singular pronoun <em>I</em> only in the question part of FAQs
and when authors of blogs or signed articles are describing their own
actions or opinions.</li>
<li>Avoid switching person (point of view) in the same document. Switching
person is acceptable, however, in blog posts that use first-person singular
but then switch to second person for instructional steps.</li>

<h2>Use consistent terminology<a class="headerlink" href="#use-consistent-terminology" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Use words as they are defined in a general dictionary, in an accepted
industry dictionary or style guide, or for your particular project. Each
word or phrase should have only one meaning, and should be used
consistently throughout the documentation.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Don't use the same word to describe two or more different concepts.
For example, don't use <em>agent</em> to refer to both a person and a
process.</li>
<li>If a word has both a technical meaning and a general meaning, don't
use it to express both meanings. Instead, use a synonym for the
general meaning. For example, use <em>interface</em> as a noun that means
user interface. Instead of also using <em>interface</em> as a verb, use
<em>interact</em>.</li>
<li>Don't use different words to mean the same thing. Standardize on the
use of one word for a particular object. Technical writing isn't
creative writing, and you shouldn't be concerned that you will bore
users with colorless prose. Clarity is the goal, so using a
precise set of terms consistently is required. Following is a common
example of multiple terms that refer to the same thing:<ul>
<li>menu command <em>(the preferred term)</em></li>
<li>menu item</li>
<li>menu option</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use a word as only one part of speech. Many words can be correctly
used as a verb and as a noun or an adjective, such as <em>display</em>.
However, using the same word as more than one part of speech in the
same document can be confusing to users and translators, so avoid
it when possible.</li>
<li>Avoid fabricated words. Examples of fabricated words are
<em>marketecture</em> or <em>edutainment</em>. Most such words are specific to a
single business culture and aren't understood in other cultures.</li>
<li>Standardize words and spelling across a documentation set.</li>
<li>Don't use terms with different meanings interchangeably. Some terms
have similar but distinct meanings and shouldn't be used
interchangeably. For example:<ul>
<li>environment, platform</li>
<li>version, release</li>
<li>panel, screen</li>
<li>window, dialog box</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Verbs are supposed to carry the action in a sentence. However, when you use

the focus from nouns to verbs by replacing weak verbs and gerunds with strong,
action-oriented verbs. Relying on verbs rather than nouns usually makes
sentences shorter, clearer, and more direct.</p>

<p>A <em>restrictive</em> clause is essential to the meaning of a sentence because it
limits the noun to which it refers. If you omit a restrictive clause, you
change the meaning of the sentence. You indicate a restrictive clause with the
relative pronoun <em>that</em> or <em>who</em>, and you don't set off a restrictive clause
with commas.</p>
<p>A <em>nonrestrictive</em> clause doesn't change the core meaning of the
sentence. You set off a nonrestrictive clause with commas and the
relative pronoun <em>which</em> or <em>who</em>.</p>

<p>When you use correct punctuation, you help users understand what you mean
<em>the first time</em> they read the text. Following are a few basic guidelines to
apply:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Use a comma before the last item in a series (known as the <em>serial</em>
comma).</li>
<li>Use a comma to separate independent clauses, and be sure to include a
coordinating conjunction.</li>
<li>Avoid using semicolons to separate clauses. They can make long
sentences seem even longer. You can almost always use a period in the
place of a semicolon.</li>
<li>Don't use a slash mark (/) to present a choice among, or a series
of, actions or objects. Rewrite the phrase to eliminate the slash
mark. Exceptions are established terms like <em>client/server</em> and
<em>read/write</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For additional specific punctuation guidelines and examples, see

<h3>Use culture-neutral language and examples<a class="headerlink" href="#use-culture-neutral-language-and-examples" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Cultural references and examples in your documentation can cause
problems for a global audience and for translation. Sounds, colors,
animals, gestures, events, and symbols don't convey the same meaning in
every culture.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Don't use the names of places, public figures, or holidays. If you
must, use examples that represent a variety of cultures or that are
internationally recognized. For example, use international cities,
such as Paris, New York, Tokyo, London, and Hong Kong.</li>
<li>Don't use political, religious, ethnic, or historical references.</li>
<li>Don't use metaphors that are specific to one culture (for example,
an American football metaphor).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Use culture-neutral graphics<a class="headerlink" href="#use-culture-neutral-graphics" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Use graphics whenever possible to present processes and complex ideas.
However, be aware of the following possible issues:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Some users don't typically read from left to right. If a
graphics illustrates a sequence, make that sequence explicit by using
numbers, arrows, or directional terms.</li>
<li>Don't rely on color alone to convey meaning. The color red, for
example, has different meanings in different countries so could be
interpreted differently by different users. Also, colors can have
political or religious significance. Use neutral colors as often as
possible.</li>
<li>Don't use a picture of a hand by itself (for example, a hand that is
pointing). Almost every hand gesture is offensive to someone. A
picture of a hand that is holding an item or interacting with
something is generally acceptable.</li>
<li>Use generic or international images. Some examples are soccer players
and equipment, generic landscapes, pens and pencils, and generic
images of computer equipment. Avoid using images of men, women,
flags, maps, animals, alcohol, trendy objects, historical references,
or film, cartoon, or video characters.</li>
