A Guide to Security with Rackspace Private Cloud
================================================

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rackspace Private Cloud offers improved security soltions for your
applications when compared to the above the degree of protection
available within a Rackspace Public Cloud.

Inter-service communication happens completely between internal
networks.

Rackspace Private Cloud Security

RPC can provide your environment with LDAP authentication, tied in to
third-party systems.

Using Elastic Search, Logstash, and Kibana, RPC proveds a robust
security solution for your environment.

Data Centre Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rackspace Data centers around the globe supprt RPC. Physical Security
capabilities employed by Rackspace Data Centres include:

* A Two-factor authentication requirement for entering the facilities.
* Electro-mechanical locks controled by biometric authentication
  (hand geometry, fingerprint scanner) and key card badges combined.
* Closed circuit video surveillance installed at all entrace points in
  the building's interior and exterior, with Cameras monitored 24x7x365
  by on-site security personnel, and data retanied for 90 days.
* Centralized Security Management Systems deployed at all Data centers
  control the Electronic Access Systems and Closed Circuit Television Networks.
* Sensitive equipment storage, including customer servers, is
  restricted to secure sub-areas within each Data Center's perimiter.
* Role-specific access only to secure sub-areas.
* Authorized Rackspace personnel's access to the facility is
  reviewed on a monthly basis.
* Role-Change and Termination procedures are ensure that any physical
  or logical access rights are removed in a timely manner when personnel
  access is no longer necessary or appropriate.

Rackspace Data Centres remain operational 24x7x365. Staff work
around-the-clock within security, engineering, and operations teams.

Security with Ansible
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Containers reduce the cost associated with establishing security
for the Private Cloud. RPC reference architectecture can continue
to provide security for the Private cloud regardless of the number of
nodes. When setting up an environment, Ansible combined with OpenStack
software ensures no service generates problems from unique sources. Each
security pathway remains the same, even if the environment runs with
1 or 500 nodes.

No default passwords are used. Passwords are either set up when you
begin using your environment, or by Rackspace support if they are
completing set up steps for you.

Security Strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Security in the RPC is multi-faceted.

Incident Response Program
-------------------------

In the event of security problems, RPC takes specific steps to
ensure data remains safe:

Tell security story with an example of data safeguarding following an incident.
