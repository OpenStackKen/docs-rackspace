<p>This section provides usage guidelines for general terms. The table indicates the following special types of terms:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Restricted</em>: Terms that can create problems if used incorrectly</li>
<li><em>Avoid</em>: Terms to avoid in favor of better alternatives</li>
<li><em>Do not use</em>: Terms that should not be used</li>

<p>A blank cell in the &quot;Special Usage&quot; column indicates that a word is generally acceptable and should be used as directed in the &quot;Comments&quot; column.</p>
<p>Additionally, the table uses the following abbreviations to indicate parts of speech:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>(v)=verb</li>
<li>(n)=noun</li>
<li>(adj)=adjective</li>
<li>(adv)=adverb</li>

instead of <em>field</em> to describe a box (including a text box, list box,
group box, combo box, and spin box) within a dialog box or window. When
citing a specific UI element name, use only box with the name (for
example, <strong>Candidate</strong> box, not <strong>Candidate</strong> list box) except when
