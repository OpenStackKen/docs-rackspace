Unit for standard audit: A unit is the content is reviewed on a single quality checklist.

The standard Unit needs to be flexible across the docs portfolio. It needs to be measurable, such 
that a percent increase across quarters becomes visible after testing.

The review process remains a key component of the Quality Checking (QC) process. A rigorous checking 
procedure that checks content additions from outside contributors, but also allowing contributors to 
merge their own Pull Requests is a goal for the QC process.


**For initial quality checks**:

-  An entire section of API documentation, such as Getting Started Guide, Developer Guide, API 
   Reference, or Release Notes (for an example see https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud- orchestration/v1/developer-guide/) 
   equals one standard unit. (The goal it to complete a quality checklist for all sections of any 
   API documentation before moving to using Pull Requests as the standard unit as noted below 
   under **After initial quality checks**).

-  A single How-to article equals one standard unit.
    

**After initial quality checks**:
        
-  The standard unit for API documentation will change to a single Pull Request (for example, if a 
   PR for a new chapter of an API doc is submitted to the repo, the new chapter=one standard audit unit).

-  A single How-to article equals one standard unit (the same as for initial quality checks).

**Other items that might be included in the quality check**:

-  Percentage of documents checked

_  Page count checked

-  Sections or chapters checked
