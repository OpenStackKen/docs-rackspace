# Editorial review process

The following steps are for documents that have been through a technical review, and for updates to existing documents:

Note: For very minor updates to existing documents, a editorial review is not required. The Doc team member reviews the 
      PR for style and basic edits, and then merges the PR.

1. After receiving a GitHub PR notification that a new Pull Request (PR) has come in, a Doc team member communicates via GitHub 
   acknowledging that the PR is in the queue and is being reviewed.

2. The Doc team member makes sure a Waffle card is created in the Rackspace Developer Experience Current Sprint board to track 
   progress on the PR.

3.  A Docs team member reviews the PR and suggests changes based the editing checklist at  
    https://one.rackspace.com/pages/viewpage.action?title=Minimal+editing+checklist+for+KC&spaceKey=devdoc 
    and notifies the technical editor that the PR is ready for editorial review.

4.  The technical editor reviews the PR and provides changes.

5.  A Docs team member handles any changes from the technical editor. 

6.  A Docs team member merges the PR, and then updates and closes the Waffle card.
