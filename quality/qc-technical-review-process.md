# Technical review process

The following steps are for a new document or for significant updates to existing documents.

Note: For minor updates to existing documents, a technical review is not required. The PR request sent on for immediate 
Editorial review. For more information, see Editorial review.

1. After receiving a GitHub PR notification that a new Pull Request (PR) has come in, a Doc team member communicates via GitHub 
   acknowledging that the PR is in the queue and has been sent for technical review to the Product Manager.

2. The Doc team member makes sure a Waffle card is created in the Rackspace Developer Experience Current Sprint board to track progress on the PR.

3. Doc team member notifies the Product Manager for the team to perform the technical review requesting the answer to this 
   question: Is the content is technically accurate and should it be shared with customers? 

   Note:  On the PR, you can add a new comment requesting review with an @ mention if the Product Manager has a GitHub account. 
   GitHub will automatically send a notification. Otherwise, send an e-mail to the Product Manager. 

4. If the PR is **approved to move forward** by the Product Manager, the Product Manager has the option to approve the technical 
   content of PR immediately, or forward the review request to another team member. 

5. The technical reviewer is likely to provide some feedback via PR comments or e-mail. The contributor makes changes to the 
   existing PR, and then sends a request for another review to the technical review via @ mention in the existing PR.  

6. After the technical reviewer approves the PR, it moves to Editorial review by the technical editor and the Doc team member. 

7. After Editorial review, the PR will be merged by the technical editor or Doc team member. 

8. If the PR is **not approved**, the writing team sends an email to the contributor that the document or document updates did not 
   pass technical review, updates the PR comments and closes the PR, and updates the Waffle card and closes the card.
