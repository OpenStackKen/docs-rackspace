========================================
RPC Docs + the rest of RPC = better docs
========================================

The documentation team needs to interact more formally and routinely with other
RPC teams that consume (and probably contribute to) documentation including
support, QE, development, and sales/marketing to improve communication and
yield more practical/accurate documentation.

For all teams, schedule a weekly meeting between one or two members of the
documentation team and one or more influential members of the other team.


Support
-------

**Primary issues**:

* Difficulty with feedback due to ambiguous mechanisms for reporting/tracking
  issues.
* Conflicting information from Support and QE in testing results/reviews of
  docs.
* Support's own internal documentation is a separate content base.

At least until we converge on a single reporting mechanism, the meeting agenda
would primarily consist of a “soft” way to obtain feedback from support. In
other words, support reports issues during the meeting and the documentation
team member reports/tracks them using the appropriate mechanism(s). The same
agenda item would include progress reports on existing issues.

Initial meetings should also include an audit of internal documentation that
support publishes and maintains to determine if/how the documentation team
can merge it into the “primary" documentation.


QE
--

**Primary issues**

* Keeping QE up to date on the most current documentation.
* Difficulty with feedback due to ambiguous mechanisms for reporting/tracking
  issues.

At least until we converge on a single mechanism, the meeting agenda would
primarily consist of a “soft” way to obtain feedback from QE.

The documentation team also needs to ensure that QE knows how to find the most
current/accurate documentation for each environment, test, etc. This is
affected by the changing status of the publishing toolchain.


Sales and marketing
-------------------

**Primary issues**

* Keeping sales and marketing up to date on the most current documentation.
* Providing sales with the documentation tools they need for customer
  interactions.
* Difficulty with feedback due to ambiguous mechanisms for reporting/tracking
  issues.

Potential customers should be able to find relevant documentation. Sales should
have the information that they need to make appropriate offerings to customers.
The contents of marketing and sales should accurately portray the product,
using the documentation as a reference. For example, if the product doesn’t
support seamless upgrades, don’t advertise it.


Development
-----------
**Primary issues**

* Notifying the documentation team of changes that may impact documentation and
  locations of these impacts.
* Difficulty with feedback due to ambiguous mechanisms for reporting/tracking
  issues.

For example, a patch for O-A may include a documentation change to the in-tree
documentation, but not necessarily trigger a change to the RPC documentation.
The meeting agenda should also include development of a plan to consolidate the
reporting/tracking mechanism and potentially consolidation of documentation
between O-A and RPC.
